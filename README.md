**`Digital Craftsman (Developer)`**

**Coding is like writing poetry for computers – carefully crafting lines to bring functionality to life.**

I'm a product-minded engineer who ships AI products, automation workflows, and cinematic UI—from planning and orchestration to polish and observability. Every launch in my portfolio is built end-to-end: data contracts, retrieval/evals, Temporal pipelines, design systems, and high-performance deployment.

 <summary><h3>Welcome to My Journey 🚀</h3></summary>
Hello and welcome!

I started by modding Android ROMs, and that curiosity spiraled into a decade of building software: automation scripts, full-stack platforms, Linux experiments, and now AI-first products. Today I lead squads shipping copilots, realtime dashboards, and ops automation—linking research ideas to production-ready, measurable outcomes.

On [xerocore](https://xerocore.in) you'll find:

- AI product engineering case studies (Atlas Copilot, Volt Sense, Muse Autopilot).
- Experience & expertise sections detailing LLM orchestration, automation, and data/MLOps work.
- A cinematic Three.js hero that adapts to the viewport and a contact flow with a ready-to-send template.

Thanks for stopping by—let's ship something intelligent together. 😊
