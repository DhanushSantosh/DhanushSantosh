**`Digital Craftsman (Developer)`**

**Coding is like writing poetry for computers – carefully crafting lines to bring functionality to life.**

I'm an full-stack developer who wants to build my own version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.

 <summary><h3>Welcome to My Tech Journey 🚀</h3></summary>
**Hello and Welcome!**
 
My journey into the world of technology began with my first Android device, sparking an innate curiosity about how things work beneath the surface. From an early age, I was fascinated by customization, experimenting with custom ROMs, and exploring new features. This passion soon led me to the world of programming, where I found myself captivated by the endless possibilities of software development.
 
I started as an enthusiastic IT student, eager to absorb as much knowledge as possible—delving into programming fundamentals, Unix/Linux systems, and eventually transitioning into full-stack web development. My interests expanded into backend technologies, where I explored Java for Android development, Python for automation, and iOS development with aspirations of building my own applications. However, as I progressed, my focus shifted towards learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), recognizing their significance in writing efficient and scalable software.

My goal is to deepen my understanding of the ever-evolving tech landscape and contribute meaningfully to its growth. Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, I aspire to make a lasting impact.

Thanks for stopping by, I look forward to collaborating and growing together in this exciting field!😊
